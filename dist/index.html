          <hr></hr>
          <p>
            The moon Io is the most volcanically active world in the solar system. Io even has lakes of molten silicate lava on its surface.

          <h2>EUROPA</h2>
          <hr></hr>
          <p>
            Europa is the sixth-largest moon in the solar system and Jupiter's fourth-largest satellite. Despite its cracked and discolored appearance, it is the smoothest solid object in the solar system; its highest peaks, of which there are few, only reach a few hundred meters tall, and large craters are rare.

          <h2>GANYMEDE</h2>
          <hr></hr>
          <p>
            Ganymede is the only moon known to have its own magnetic field – something typically found on planets like Earth. The magnetic field causes auroras, or bright ribbons of glowing gas, that circle the moon's poles. There is evidence Ganymede has a tenuous oxygen atmosphere.

          <hr></hr>
          <p>
            Callisto is Jupiter's second largest moon and the third largest moon in our solar system. Its surface is the most heavily cratered of any object in our solar system. Images of Callisto captured by passing spacecraft show bright white spots standing out against darker regions.
